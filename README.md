Uses slackcat, https://github.com/rlister/slackcat, to feed a rant, over seven minutes
about why
email still has value into a Slack channel. I deliberately included syntax 
errors to make it seem like a real-time composition.

The content is the content, but the demonsration part is that reading an
argument while someone is composing it, instead of after it's written, is
going to take a long time. And you never know when you're going to drop into a
long discourse over some topic.


TODO:
The 7 minutes should change to compute actual time using a heredoc, but good
enough for now.
